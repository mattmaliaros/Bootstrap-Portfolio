        <p>Hi my name is Matt Maliaros. I am aspiring to be a full-stack developer at Rutgers.</p>

        <p>I have a degree in Computer Information Systems from DeVry University. While I have a background in
            programming,
            I never truly mastered web development (HTML, CSS, JS, etc) until I started taking this class. I look
            forward
            to expanding my skills within this class to start freelancing, working on personal projects, and hopefully
            acquiring a full-time position within web development.
        </p>

        <p>Here we have my edited portfolio with projects that I have been working on. These projects display my
            abilities
            learned from Rutgers and self-teachings. I will continually refine the projects as I learn more and more
            about
            these languages.
        </p>
